@par Example Description 

The examples provide a composite device.
A composite device is one that has multiple interfaces controlled independently of each other.
Using composite device, multiple functions are combined into a single device.
In this Example the independent interfaces are : Mass Storage (MSC) and (HID).

This Example was created by combining the code in the usbd_hid (HID) and usbd_msc (mass storage)

The implementation of the composite HID-MSC device is done by creating a wrapping
class (see folder msc_hid_wrapper ) that makes calls to the separate HID and MSC class layer
handlers (files usbd_custom_hid_core.c and usb_msc_core.c files).

To test the demo, you can access to SDcard content and in same time you can run Custom HID demo.

When even one of the interface class of the device is changed, it should be handled
differently by Windows. However, it doesn't recognize the modification. To avoid conflict on
Windows, we suggest to assign another VID/PID to the device or delete device instance from device manager.  

@par Hardware and Software environment 

	- This example runs on STM32F072xB devices
	- This example has been tested with STM32072B-EVAL and can be easily tailored 
     to any other supported device and development board.

    - STM32072B-EVAL Set-up
       - Use CN4 connector to connect the board to a PC host through USB cable
       - Insert the MicroSD card in the CN9 connector (right side of the board).

@par How to use it ?
