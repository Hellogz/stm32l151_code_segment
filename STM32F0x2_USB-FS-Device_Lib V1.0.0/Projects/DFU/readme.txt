@par Example Description 

This Demo presents the implementation of a device firmware upgrade (DFU) capability
in the STM32F072 USB device.

It follows the DFU class specification defined by the USB Implementers Forum for 
reprogramming an application through USB-FS-Device. 
The DFU principle is particularly well suited to USB-FS-Device applications that 
need to be reprogrammed in the field

To have an example of how to generate a DFU image, please refer to the project 
provided in folder "binary_template". This project allows to generate a binary
image (*.bin file) that can be used to generate a *.dfu image using the tool
provided by ST: "DFUse\DFU File Manager" available for download from www.st.com

Once the *.dfu image is generated, it can be downloaded into internal flash memory
using the ST tool "DFUse\DFUse Demonstration" or the tool "DFUse\STDFU Tester" both
available for download from www.st.com

The supported memory for this example is the Internal Flash memory
To add a new memory interface you can use the template memory interface provided 
in folder \Libraries\STM32_USB_Device_Library\Class\dfu.

@note After each device reset, hold down the TAMPER push-button on the STM32072B-EVAL board
     
@par Hardware and Software environment 

   - This example runs on STM32F072xB devices
   - This example has been tested with STM32072B-EVAL and can be easily tailored
     to any other supported device and development board.

   - STM32072B-EVAL Set-up
       - Use CN4 connector to connect the board to a PC host through USB cable
