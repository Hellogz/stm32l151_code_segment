@par Example Description 

This Demo provides a description of how to use the USB-FS-Device on the STM32F072 device.
The STM32 device is enumerated as HID compliant device, that uses the native PC 
Host USB-FS-Device HID driver.

To test the example, you need to:

  1)- Start the "USB HID Demonstrator" PC applet and connect STM32 USB to PC
  2)- The device should be detected and shown in the USB HID target box
  3)- Press Graphic View button
  4)- You can Select "use SET_FEATURE" or "use SET_REPORT" in order to use SET_REPORT request to send HID Report
       for LED control
  5)- You can use the potentiometer of the evaluation board to transfer the result of the converted voltage (By the ADC)
  the to the PC host (these values are sent to the PC using the endpoint1 IN)   
  5)- Make sure that following report ID are configured: LED1 ID (0x1) , LED2 ID(0x2),
       LED3 ID(0x3), LED4 ID(0x4), BUTTON1_ID(0x6) and Potentiometer_ID(0x7).
  6)- Select Leds to switch on/off on the EVAL board => a SET_REPORT request will be sent


@par Hardware and Software environment 

   - This example runs on STM32F072xB devices
   - This example has been tested with STM32072B-EVAL and can be easily tailored
     to any other supported device and development board.

   - STM32072B-EVAL Set-up
       - Use CN4 connector to connect the board to a PC host through USB cable
