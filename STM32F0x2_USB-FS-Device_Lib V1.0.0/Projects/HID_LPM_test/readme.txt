@par Example Description 

This example allows to test the USB LPM (Link Power Management) Feature.

The example is based on HID mouse example. All modifications versus original HID 
example are under #ifdef LPM_ENABLED which is defined in usb_conf.h file.

When LPM packet is received from Host, STM32 USB will Acknowledge the LPM packet
and it will enter in L1 suspend mode. During USB L1 suspend mode ,system will be
in STOP low power mode.

On Host L1 resume, STM32 will wakeup from STOP and USB resumes operations.

The example also implements the USB L1 remotewakeup, which allows device to wakeup
host during L1 suspend. L1 remote wakeup is initiated when pressing the Tamper 
button.

You can test L1 suspend/resume, by running the USBCV3.0 chapter9 for USB2.0 devices 
and select (in debug mode) test "TD9.21: LPM L1 Suspend Resume Test".
Please note that for running USBCV3.0, you'll need a PC with a USB3.0 (xHCI)
host controller (please refer to USBCV3.0 documentation for more informations).

You can also find in folder \Projects\USBCV3.0_Test , the full USBCV3.0 chapter9
test report and a USB trace (using Lecroy USB Protocol Suite tool) showing 
the USB trace for the LPM test.

As it can be seen in the trace, STM32 Acknowledges the LPM packet, then after 50us 
resume, STM32 is ready to receive transactions from host, it answers a GetDescriptor
request.


@par Hardware and Software environment 

   - This example runs on STM32F072xB devices
   - This example has been tested with STM32072B-EVAL and can be easily tailored
     to any other supported device and development board.

   - STM32072B-EVAL Set-up
       - Use CN4 connector to connect the board to a PC host through USB cable
